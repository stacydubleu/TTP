		<p> Hello! I really like cats. Here on this website I will be writing about my afternoon with a very friendly garden cat. The Kitten And Falling Leaves. By William Wordsworth. THAT way look, my Infant, lo! What a pretty baby-show! See the kitten on the wall, Sporting with the leaves that fall, Withered leaves---one---two---and three--- From the lofty elder-tree! Through the calm and frosty air Of this morning bright and fair, Eddying round and round they sink Softly, slowly: one might think, From the motions that are made, Every little leaf conveyed Sylph or Faery hither tending,--- To this lower world descending, Each invisible and mute, In his wavering parachute. ---But the Kitten, how she starts, Crouches, stretches, paws, and darts! First at one, and then its fellow Just as light and just as yellow; There are many now---now one--- Now they stop and there are none What intenseness of desire In her upward eye of fire! With a tiger-leap half way Now she meets the coming prey, Lets it go as fast, and then Has it in her power again: Now she works with three or four, Like an Indian conjurer; Quick as he in feats of art, Far beyond in joy of heart. Were her antics played in the eye Of a thousand standers-by, Clapping hands with shout and stare, What would little Tabby care For the plaudits of the crowd? Over happy to be proud, Over wealthy in the treasure Of her own exceeding pleasure! 'Tis a pretty baby-treat; Nor, I deem, for me unmeet;Here, for neither Babe nor me, Other play-mate can I see. Of the countless living things, That with stir of feet and wings(In the sun or under shade, Upon bough or grassy blade)
